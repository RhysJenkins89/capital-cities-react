# Doing

-   Deploy site to rhysjenkins.uk

## To do

-   Add caching to useQuery
-   Sort Vite config warning
-   Add an error boundary to the app
-   Build a backend service
-   Add an external database
-   Add flags
-   Add testing
-   Add ESLint

## Notes

At the time of writing, the site deploys from the `gh-pages-source` branch. Pushing code to this branch's remote will deploy the site. Development of the site is currently done on the `main` branch.
